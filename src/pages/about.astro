                        What began as an impulse buy during the pandemic has become a much more
                        time-consuming pastime! Tony seeks out dark skies for visual observing and
                        enjoys the challenge of astrophotography - whether from home in Ottawa or
                        remotely with Vantage Point Astro. In his remaining free time, he can often
                        be found outside, hiking or cross-country skiing.

                        Richard Taylor has been an amateur astronomer since his parents gave him a
                        Tasco telescope about 60 years ago. He started doing astrophotography with
                        film cameras in the 1990s but happily switched to digital when affordable
                        digital cameras became available. Since he retired from teaching high school
                        Physics in 2018, he has spent more time on image processing both for astro
                        and general photography. Richard also enjoys designing and building Lego
                        models with his granddaughter.
