Welcome to **Vista and Void**, a collaborative space where our team of astrophotographers shares our passion for capturing the cosmos.

## Our Mission

We believe that the night sky belongs to everyone. Through this blog, we aim to:

- **Share our work**: From deep sky objects to wide-field Milky Way shots, we'll showcase the images we're most proud of
- **Document our process**: Learn about the gear, techniques, and post-processing workflows we use
- **Build community**: Connect with fellow astrophotography enthusiasts and inspire each other

## What to Expect

On this blog, you'll find:

- **Photo galleries**: Our latest captures organized by project
- **Behind-the-scenes posts**: Stories from our imaging sessions
- **Gear reviews**: Honest takes on telescopes, mounts, cameras, and accessories
- **Processing tutorials**: Tips for getting the most out of your astrophotography data
