Hickson Compact Group 44 (HCG 44) is a small, tightly packed group of interacting galaxies located about 60–80 million light-years away in the constellation Leo. It is part of the catalog of compact galaxy groups compiled by astronomer Paul Hickson in 1982. The group's main members include three spiral galaxies and one elliptical galaxy, whose close proximity leads to gravitational interactions that distort their shapes and trigger bursts of star formation.
