Markarian's Chain is a striking curved line of galaxies located in the heart of the Virgo Cluster, about 50–60 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Virgo. The chain is named after Armenian astronomer Benjamin Markarian, who identified that several of its galaxies share a common motion through space. Prominent members include Messier 84 and Messier 86, along with many other elliptical and lenticular galaxies. This image also includes the massive elliptical galaxy, Messier 87, in the upper left.
